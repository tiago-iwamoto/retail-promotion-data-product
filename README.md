# Retail Promotion Performance – Data Product Case Study

## Overview

This repository documents a business-driven data product case study focused on promotion performance in a retail context.

The goal is to structure it as a reliable product that supports decision-making.

This data product aims to:

- Deliver finalized daily revenue dataset with a clearly defined availability window
- Standardize promotion and discount metrics across stores
- Separate business guarantees from technical enforcement
- Clarify ownership, SLA expectations, and accountability boundaries

The project illustrates how a data product can be designed with:

- A well-defined business context
- Explicit data quality guarantees
- Clear ownership and responsibilities
- Measurable success criteria and realistic risk awareness
- Technical implementation aligned with the defined contract (dbt + Snowflake)
